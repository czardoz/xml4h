xml4h: XML for Humans
=====================

xml4h is an ISC licensed library for Python to make working with XML a
human-friendly activity.

This library exists because Python is awesome, XML is everywhere, and the
combination of the two should be a pleasure not a pain.

This project is heavily inspired by the
`Requests HTTP library <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`.
